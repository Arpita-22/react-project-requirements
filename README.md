# React Project! 

We've made it! You're ready to built a React application! Before you start ideating, think about some of the project requirements. Some ideas (games) may not work well for this project. 

### Requirements

1. You must use a Rails API backend with a separate React front end.
2. Your backend must have at least one resource. 
3. Your application must have full CRUD actions for at least one resource. 
4. __Optional:__ Your application can have authentication/authorization. (**reminder use the auth template**)
5. Modularize your application into seperate files and folders based on purpose of code. 
6. Any calls to 3rd-party APIs must be made through your back end.

#### Bonus
1. Implement a new node package you have never used. (Socket.io, Chart.js, Draggable.js)
2. Refactor your code using HOCs.
3. Go above and beyond in styling for animations and transitions.

### Setup

Your apps should live in separate repositories. This means you will have two separate repos. 

1. You should generate your API using the following command: `rails new my-project-api --api -T --database=postgresql`. (Setting your database up as Postgres initially will make deployment easier at a later stage.) 
2. To create your React project, you may use a tool called [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), an awesome project generator developed by Facebook. To use this
	+ `npm install -g create-react-app` - this installs the generator as a global package
	+ In the directory where you'd like to create your project, `create-react-app my-project-client`. It's that simple! 

**NOTE** by default - both your client app and your rails app will run on port 3000. Check out this [issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1083) if you'd like to change the default.
